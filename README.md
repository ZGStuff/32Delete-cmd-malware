# 32Delete-cmd-malware
A piece of malware designed to destroy the Windows installation via Command Prompt.
It deletes the Users, System32, SysWOW64, and WinSxS folders in Windows 8/8.1/10
It's a PC killer!
It is UNTESTED, so please wait before testing yourself.
It is also unfinished.
It is composed of one command script.
Full code is written as text files, but is fully compiled as a .cmd file for the final release.
Also, the script(s) should be run directly inside the C:/Users/*your username* folder in Windows for optimal performance (unless you installed Windows to your personal folder...)
That is what you need to know.
